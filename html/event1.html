The Nasher Museum presents a new exhibition, "The Deconstructive Impulse: Women Artists Reconfigure The Signs Of Power, 1973-1991," showing that the role of women artists has long been undervalued in accounts of that work. The exhibition is a survey of leading women artists that examines the crucial feminist contribution to the development of deconstructivism in the 1970s and 1980s. Organized by the Neuberger Museum of Art, Purchase College, State University of New York.</td></tr></table></html>
