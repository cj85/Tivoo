In response to the stereotyping of Muslims and in recognition that it is human nature to fear what we do not know, community based artist Todd Drake has worked with Muslims to create self-portraits that share real, rather than seeming, reflections of self to a wider audience. Muslims from a variety of backgrounds and living in a variety of communities participated in this series by working collaboratively with Drake to realize their own vision. The project blogsite features photographs, collaged images, and self-drawn portraits created with short essays to add context and, in some cases, audio recordings and additional information.</td></tr></table></html>
