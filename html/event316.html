The Nasher Museum presents a new exhibition, "The Deconstructive Impulse," showing that the role of women artists has long been undervalued in accounts of that work. The exhibition is a survey of leading women artists that examines the crucial feminist contribution to the development of deconstructivism in the 1970s and 1980s.</td></tr></table></body><body><h1>Summary and Details</h1><h2>Exhibition: "The Deconstructive Impulse: Women Artists Reconfigure the Signs of Power, 1973-1991."</h2><table><tr><td>Start Time: 2011-10-01 04:00:00</td></tr><tr><td>End Time: 2011-10-01 05:00:00</td></tr><tr><td>Summary: For years, the prevailing belief has been that following the identity-based artwork of the late 1960s and early 1970s, progressive women artists put aside their differences with men to help them reveal how the mass media and global capitalism control visual culture.
