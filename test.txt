Summary= This September will mark the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. As we collectively and personally remember that day, a new exhibit in Perkins Library explores what it means to memorialize. From the large-scale memorial and skyscraper currently under construction at Ground Zero to more private tributes, there are many ways of remembering, whether national or personal, official or unofficial. "The Life of Memorials" examines the process of memorializing and the social contexts that surround remembering. "The Life of Memorials" is a project of Team Kenan, an initiative of the Kenan Institute for Ethics that seeks to bring attention to ethical issues in and around the Duke community through student-organized programming. "The Life of Memorials" will be on display in the Perkins Gallery through October 16. For more information, visit the exhibit website by clicking "More Info" above.

Muslims from a variety of backgrounds and living in a variety of communities participated in this series by working collaboratively with Drake to realize their own vision. The project blogsite features photographs, collaged images, and self-drawn portraits created with short essays to add context and, in some cases, audio recordings and additional information.

Titile= Exhibition: "The Deconstructive Impulse"
StartTime= 16 Sep 2011 01:00:00 GMT
EndTime= Sat Dec 31 22:00:00 EST 2011
Summary= For years, the prevailing belief has been that following the identity-based artwork of the late 1960s and early 1970s, progressive women artists put aside their differences with men to help them reveal how the mass media and global capitalism control visual culture. The Nasher Museum presents a new exhibition, "The Deconstructive Impulse: Women Artists Reconfigure The Signs Of Power, 1973-1991," showing that the role of women artists has long been undervalued in accounts of that work. The exhibition is a survey of leading women artists that examines the crucial feminist contribution to the development of deconstructivism in the 1970s and 1980s. Organized by the Neuberger Museum of Art, Purchase College, State University of New York.

EndTime= Mon Oct 31 04:00:00 EDT 2011
Summary= The Mary Lou Williams Center for Black Culture is proud to host an exhibit that focuses on the humanity of those we sometimes take for granted. Everyday, there are a myriad of hands helping to transform Duke.  These hands nourish students, cut their hair, clean spaces, and build things.  These hands are often invisible in the visible pursuit of higher education. But, without these hands Duke would cease to be. Through black and white photography, Aron Anderson, '10  (Trinity) and W. Edmund Newsome, '11 (Divinity) capture the humanity of those we take for granted. Join us in an exhibit that questions what we take for granted and asks us to celebrate Black people who are "In The Service of Others."

Titile= Exhibition: "The Deconstructive Impulse: Women Artists Reconfigure the Signs of Power, 1973-1991."
StartTime= 27 Sep 2011 00:00:00 GMT
EndTime= Mon Sep 26 21:00:00 EDT 2011
Summary= For years, the prevailing belief has been that following the identity-based artwork of the late 1960s and early 1970s, progressive women artists put aside their differences with men to help them reveal how the mass media and global capitalism control visual culture. The Nasher Museum presents a new exhibition, "The Deconstructive Impulse," showing that the role of women artists has long been undervalued in accounts of that work. The exhibition is a survey of leading women artists that examines the crucial feminist contribution to the development of deconstructivism in the 1970s and 1980s.

Summary= "Potiche" (François Ozon, 2010, 103 min, France, 35mm) -- "Potiche" is Francois Ozon's adaptation of the hit comic play from the 1970s, reworked into his own satirical and hilarious take on the war between the sexes and classes.Suzanne - wonderfully played by the reigning queen of French film, Catherine Deneuve - is a submissive, housebound 'trophy wife' who steps in to manage the umbrella factory run by her wealthy and tyrannical husband after the workers go on strike. As she breaks free of her coddled life, proving herself to be a competent and assertive woman of action, she realizes, like many other women who discovered feminism in the 1970s, that the personal really is political. But when her husband returns from a restful cruise in top form, things get complicated. Gérard Depardieu plays a former union leader and Suzanne's ex-beau who still has feelings for her. Features impeccable 70s era set design and costumes! -- Post-screening discussion with Prof. Anne-Gaëlle Saliot!

StartTime= 27 Sep 2011 18:00:00 GMT
EndTime= Tue Sep 27 15:00:00 EDT 2011
Summary= CMOS technology has served as the foundation of modern electronics over the last 40 years. Relentless technology scaling has been the main growth engine in the semiconductor industry, bringing ever-increasing performance to the end-user while lowering product power and cost. But the miniaturization of CMOS transistors has led to increasing difficulties in achieving robust circuit design to meet high-volume manufacturing requirements as the feature size of the transistor is scaled down to the nano-regime. 

In this talk, the state of current CMOS technology scaling along with most recent technology innovations will be first discussed along with their impacts on circuit design. Then the presentation will focus on the scaling of several critical circuit areas, including SRAM and key analog circuit blocks. Some innovative design solutions will be discussed in addressing both low-power and high-performance requirements for future scaling.

The exhibition is a survey of leading women artists that examines the crucial feminist contribution to the development of deconstructivism in the 1970s and 1980s.

Sharlet's previous book, the New York Times bestseller "The Family," provided a groundbreaking, widely praised expose of the influence of Christian fundamentalism at the highest levels of American policymaking and power. In the thirteen essays collected here in his latest, Sharlet engages themes of faith and doubt on a more intimate level, investigating the drives and beliefs of others while trying to uncover what, if anything, he himself believes.

Summary= Film Screening: STALKER (Andrei Tarkovsky, 1979, 160 min, Soviet Union, in Russian w/ subtitles, Color, 35mm) -- A powerful and haunting sci-fi parable imbued by Tarkovsky with a multi-layered visual resonance and, despite its stately pace, raw emotional impact. Near a gray and unnamed city is the Zone, an alien place guarded by barbed wire and soldiers. Over his wife's numerous objections, a man rises in the dead of night: he's a stalker, one of a handful who have the mental gifts (and who risk imprisonment) to lead people into the Zone to the Room, a place where one's secret hopes come true. That night, he takes two people into the Zone: a popular writer who is burned out, cynical, and questioning his genius; and a quiet scientist more concerned about his knapsack than the journey. -- Received a special award, "the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury," at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival!

StartTime= 29 Sep 2011 20:30:00 GMT

Using a set of basic measures of judicial merit, Professors Charles, Chen and Gulati compare her performance on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to that of her colleagues on the federal appeals courts. Sotomayor matches up well. She might turn out to be more of a force on the Court than the naysayers predicted. For more information, contact Michelle Huang at michelle.x.huang@duke.edu.

StartTime= 30 Sep 2011 00:00:00 GMT

The Nasher Museum presents a new exhibition, "The Deconstructive Impulse," showing that the role of women artists has long been undervalued in accounts of that work. The exhibition is a survey of leading women artists that examines the crucial feminist contribution to the development of deconstructivism in the 1970s and 1980s.

Titile= SSRI/DuPRI Seminar Series~Why Do Women Live Longer Than Men? An Integrative Social and Biodemographic Approach to Explaining Sex Differences in Longevity
StartTime= 30 Sep 2011 21:00:00 GMT
EndTime= Fri Sep 30 18:30:00 EDT 2011
Summary= That women live longer than men may be a well-known phenomenon. But why women live longer than men is much less well understood. I first briefly review the state of knowledge about sex differences in mortality and identify gaps in this knowledge. It is useful to revisit the old but powerful hypothesis that biology plays a role. The question is how. I lay out a framework of research that integrates biology into social demographic models and population research. I focus on an initial set of questions in this framework concerning the physiological mechanisms underlying sex differences in mortality and their interconnections with social processes and present findings from three studies, including sex differences in the age trajectories of physiological dysregulation, post-reproductive change in sex mortality gap, and social relations, physiological pathways, and mortality.

StartTime= 30 Sep 2011 23:00:00 GMT
EndTime= Sat Oct 01 22:00:00 EDT 2011
Summary= The publication in 1986 of Writing Culture: the Poetics and Politics of Ethnography transformed the field of cultural anthropology.

On this occasion of the 25th anniversary of its publication, we revisit Writing Culture to ponder the state of the field, the practice of ethnography, and the politics and poetics of ¿writing culture¿ today.

StartTime= 1 Oct 2011 00:00:00 GMT
EndTime= Fri Sep 30 21:00:00 EDT 2011
Summary= For years, the prevailing belief has been that following the identity-based artwork of the late 1960s and early 1970s, progressive women artists put aside their differences with men to help them reveal how the mass media and global capitalism control visual culture. The Nasher Museum presents a new exhibition, "The Deconstructive Impulse," showing that the role of women artists has long been undervalued in accounts of that work. The exhibition is a survey of leading women artists that examines the crucial feminist contribution to the development of deconstructivism in the 1970s and 1980s.

Titile= Zakir Hussain & Rakesh Chaurasia

Summary= In this unforgettable concert of intricately melodious music for tabla and flute, two great dynasties of Indian classical music converge.
 
Worldwide percussion icon Zakir Hussain is the son of legendary tabla player Alla Rakha, and returns to Page after a stunning concert there two years ago. Rakesh Chaurasia is the nephew and pupil of bansuri flute maestro Hariprasad Chaurasia. The bansuri is a simple tube of bamboo that is difficult to master and transcendent in tone. 

Pairing fluent rhythm and melody, these virtuosi tap into South Asian traditions to forge a sound where modernity and myth intertwine.

Zakir Hussain and Rakesh Chaurasia are presented, in part, with support from the Indian Classical Music and Dance Society

Titile= Exhibition: "The Deconstructive Impulse: Women Artists Reconfigure the Signs of Power, 1973-1991."
StartTime= 2 Oct 2011 00:00:00 GMT
EndTime= Sat Oct 01 21:00:00 EDT 2011
Summary= For years, the prevailing belief has been that following the identity-based artwork of the late 1960s and early 1970s, progressive women artists put aside their differences with men to help them reveal how the mass media and global capitalism control visual culture. The Nasher Museum presents a new exhibition, "The Deconstructive Impulse," showing that the role of women artists has long been undervalued in accounts of that work. The exhibition is a survey of leading women artists that examines the crucial feminist contribution to the development of deconstructivism in the 1970s and 1980s.

Titile= Orion String Quartet & Windscape
StartTime= 1 Oct 2011 04:00:00 GMT
EndTime= Sat Oct 01 02:00:00 EDT 2011
Summary= BACH: The Art of the Fugue for String Quartet and Wind Quintet, BWV 1080 (arr. Samuel Baron, 1960) ### "The Orion String Quartet is prized for its command of both the classical repertory and contemporary music by composers like Lowell Liebermann and Wynton Marsalis. Likewise, the distinguished woodwind soloists who compose Windscape - the Manhattan School of Music's ensemble-in-residence - draw insightful connections all over the musical map. 

In Durham, these institutions combine their forces in the landmark Art of the Fugue, where Bach elaborates a simple subject toward profound complexity without specifying any particular instrumentation. Samuel Baron's 1960 arrangement for string quartet, flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, and horn supplies 80 minutes of ravishing ensemble color to the intensely logical score.
